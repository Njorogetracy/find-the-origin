### Browser Compatibility

Website was tested manually on these browsers: Google Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari. The results were satisfactory.

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs
- Score Area content was overflowing outside of the div in medium to small screens, this was fixed by adding a display flex property
- Restart button was not being displayed in the end game page, this was fixed by creating it in the index.html and adding it to end page usig innerhtml in javascript


#### Unfixed Bugs
- User can pick more that one question, the expected behavior is for the user to pick one answer per question
